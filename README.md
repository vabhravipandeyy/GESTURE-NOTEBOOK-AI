# 🖐️ Gesture Notebook AI

A **Gesture-Based Virtual Notebook** built using **Computer Vision**, **MediaPipe**, and **Python** where your **finger works like a pen** and hand gestures control drawing and erasing — completely touchless.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Gesture Notebook AI allows users to write notes in the air using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

Instead of using a mouse, stylus, or touchscreen:

* ☝️ **Index Finger → Draw**
* ✊ **Fist Gesture → Eraser**
* 🎥 Live webcam preview
* 📒 Digital notebook interface

This project demonstrates **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** using AI-powered hand tracking.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gesture-Notebook-AI.git
cd Gesture-Notebook-AI
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pillow
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python gesture_notebook.py
```

---

## 🖐️ Gesture Controls

| Gesture            | Action |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| ☝️ Index Finger Up | Draw   |
| ✊ Fist             | Erase  |
| Relaxed Hand       | Stop   |

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Webcam captures live video.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
3. Index finger movement controls drawing.
4. Gesture recognition switches between draw and erase modes.
5. Canvas updates in real-time.
